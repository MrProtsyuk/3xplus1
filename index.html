        The Collatz Conjecture, or better known as the 3x + 1 problem, is a math
        problem that has baffled mathematicians for over 50 years. It's easy to
        explain: take any positive number, if it's even, divide it by 2; if it's
        odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process with the resulting
        number, and the conjecture says that you will eventually reach 1.
